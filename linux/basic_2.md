This exercise will provide you details about some administrative commands with examples. Here, you can learn how to change permissions for files and folders to modify its accessibility and commands to obtain information about the system you are using.
## Changing permissions  
All files in the UNIX system will have a set of permissions which define what can be done with that file and by whom. Here, what refers to read (view contents), write (modify) and execute (run as a script) and whom refers to user (owner), group (collection of users that the user belongs to) and others (everyone else).  
To look at the permissions for any file, you can list the files with `l` option (`ls â€“l`). Permissions User	Group	Size	Date modified	Name.
