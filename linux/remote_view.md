Many times the results generated by the bioinformatics programs are either simple `text` files (tab/comma seperated), `pdf` files or in some rare cases `png/jpeg` files. Here we will show you how to view these files without having to download them locally to your machine.
## Text files  
The `text` files are the easiest. You can use any of the standard UNIX commands to view them. There are many commands for this purpose such as:  

Command |	Purpose |	Example |	Use cases
--- | --- | --- | ---
`less` |	view file pagewise with more options |	`less` filename	| use `-S` to avoid line wrapping, you can use arrow keys to scroll
`more` |	view file pagewise	| `more` filename	| use `less` instead
`cat` |	catalogs the contents of a file	| `cat` filename	| you can send the contenst of a file to clipboard or to another file using this command
`tac` |	reverse of `cat`, reverses the order of lines	| `tac` filename	| pipe this to `less` commad to scroll through the file in reverse
`head` |	view first few lines of a file |	`head` filename	| use `-n` option to change the number of lines displayed. `-n 20` displays 20 lines
`tail` |	view last few lines of a file	| `tail` filename |	use `-n` option to change the number of lines displayed. `-n 20` displays 20 lines
`od` |	octal dump of a file |	`od` filename	| use`-c` options and pipe it through less. You can see non printable characters with this option (like tab, whitespace, newline etc)
