Project management is defined as the process of keeping track of the many inputs and outputs of a project from experimental design through publication.

Many components of a project are generated, in an attempt to organize the inputs and outputs of a project. How these components relate to each other and their organized is directly related to project management.

The main components of project management include but may not be limited to:

1. Folders and Files  
2. Notebook record of commands, thought process and related code  
3. Communication and Discussion  
4. ToDo list  
5. Record of your time spent  
The rest of this tutorial steps through the components of project management, how they are related and importantly how the adoption of some very simple rules help integrate these components and do not come with a large learning curve that can be prohibitive to quick adoption by your team.
